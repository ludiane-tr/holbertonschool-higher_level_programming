# ðŸ“˜ Python - Everything is Object

Welcome to this Holberton School project that dives deep into one of Pythonâ€™s core principles: **everything is an object**. Through a series of small tasks, this project helps you better understand Python's internal behavior, including memory management, object types, and mutability.
