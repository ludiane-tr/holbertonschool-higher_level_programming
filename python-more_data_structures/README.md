# Project: Python Data Structures and Functional Programming
Learning Objectives
Understand why Python programming is awesome.
Explain and use sets, dictionaries, and their common methods.
Differentiate between sets, lists, and dictionaries and know when to use each.
Implement and utilize lambda functions and functional programming constructs like map, reduce, and filter.
Data Structures and Functional Programming
This project focuses on various Python data structures and functional programming concepts. Below, we outline key topics covered and provide examples for better understanding.

# General Concepts
Sets
What are sets?
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
Common methods:
add(): Adds an element to the set.
remove(): Removes an element from the set.
union(), intersection(), difference(): Common set operations.
When to use sets:

Use sets when you need a collection of unique elements.
Compare to lists when you require performance optimization in terms of membership testing and set operations.
Dictionaries
What are dictionaries?
Dictionaries are key-value pairs used to store data.
Common methods:
get(): Retrieves the value for a given key.
keys(), values(), items(): Access keys, values, or key-value pairs.
When to use dictionaries:

Use dictionaries when associating data with keys, e.g., {key: value} pairs.
Useful for scenarios requiring quick data retrieval and manipulation.
Lambda Functions, map(), reduce(), and filter()
Lambda functions: Anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.
map(): Applies a function to each item in an iterable.
reduce(): Combines items in an iterable using a specified function.
filter(): Filters elements from an iterable based on a condition.
