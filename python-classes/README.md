# Resources

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Through a series of resources and exercises, the goal is to grasp fundamental OOP principles, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods, as well as best practices in Pythonic OOP development.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

### General Concepts
- Understand what Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is.
- Explain the concept of "first-class everything."
- Differentiate between classes, objects, and instances.
- Define and use attributes (public, protected, and private).
- Explain the purpose and use of the `self` keyword.
- Understand methods, including the special `__init__` method.
- Grasp the concepts of data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Differentiate between attributes and properties in Python.
- Write Pythonic getters and setters.
- Dynamically create new attributes for instances and classes.
- Understand and use the `__dict__` attribute of a class or instance.
- Explain how Python resolves attributes using the `getattr` function.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files must:
  - End with a new line.
  - Start with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - Follow the `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.7.*).
  - Be executable.
  - Include documentation for modules, classes, and methods.

## File Structure
- **Modules:**
  - `module_name.py`: Implementation of specific OOP concepts.
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`: Project description and requirements.
- **Tests:**
  - Test files to verify functionality.
- **Examples:**
  - `main.py`: Files used to test the logic of the code.

## Usage
To run any module, use the following command:
```bash
./module_name.py
```

To test the logic of your code, use the `main.py` file provided in each directory.

## Tasks
- (x) Understand and implement basic OOP concepts.
- (x) Write classes and objects in Python.
- (x) Use public, protected, and private attributes.
- (x) Implement Pythonic getters and setters.
- (x) Dynamically create and bind attributes to instances and classes.
- (x) Explore and manipulate the `__dict__` attribute.
- (x) Use the `getattr` function to dynamically access attributes.
