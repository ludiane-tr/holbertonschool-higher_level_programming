# Python - Server-Side Rendering

## Description

The "Python - Server-Side Rendering" project focuses on implementing server-side rendering (SSR) using Python and Flask. SSR is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully formed HTML. This contrasts with client-side rendering, where the browser builds the web page using JavaScript and dynamic data. Through this project, you will learn how to implement SSR using Python and Flask, leveraging the Jinja templating engine to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concepts of server-side rendering (SSR) and how it differs from client-side rendering.
- Learn the benefits of using SSR in web development.
- Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework.
- Utilize the Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages.
- Read and display data from various sources, including JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases.
- Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications.

## What to Expect

In this project, you will build a Flask application that serves web pages using server-side rendering techniques. You will start by creating basic templates and gradually move towards integrating dynamic content from multiple data sources. By the end of the project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of SSR, templating, and how to build efficient, scalable web applications.

## Tasks

### Creating a Simple Templating Program

1. **Creating a Basic HTML Template in Flask**  
   Start by creating a basic HTML template in Flask and rendering it from the server.

2. **Creating a Dynamic Template with Loops and Conditions in Flask**  
   Extend your templates to include dynamic content, using loops and conditions to control what is displayed on the page.

3. **Displaying Data from JSON or CSV Files in Flask**  
   Learn to read data from JSON or CSV files and display it dynamically in your templates.

4. **Extending Dynamic Data Display to Include SQLite in Flask**  
   Integrate an SQLite database to store and display dynamic content, improving your applicationâ€™s ability to scale and handle more complex data.
